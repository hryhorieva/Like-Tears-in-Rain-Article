        <h3>Roy Batty, 2019</h3>
        <h1>Like Tears in Rain</h1>
        <h2>Where am I going? How long have I got?</h2>
        <p>I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched
            C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time... like
            tears in rain... <em>Time to die.</em>
        </p>
        <p>I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments he loved life more than he ever had
            before. Not just his life - anybody's life; my life. All he'd wanted were the same answers...</p>
